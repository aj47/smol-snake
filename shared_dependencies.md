1. "pygame" library: This is a set of Python modules designed for writing video games. All files will need to import this library to create the game interface, handle events, and control game objects.

2. "game_objects.py": This file will contain the definitions of the game objects such as the Snake and the Food. The classes and functions defined in this file will be used in "snake_game.py", "game_logic.py", and "game_ui.py".

3. "game_config.py": This file will contain the game configuration variables such as screen size, game speed, colors, etc. These variables will be used in all other files to set up the game environment and control the game behavior.

4. "game_logic.py": This file will contain the game logic functions such as the movement of the snake, collision detection, scoring, etc. These functions will be used in "snake_game.py" and "game_ui.py".

5. "game_ui.py": This file will contain the functions to create and update the game interface. These functions will be used in "snake_game.py".

6. "snake_game.py": This is the main file that will import and use the functions and variables from all other files to run the game.

7. "Snake" class: This class will be defined in "game_objects.py" and used in "snake_game.py", "game_logic.py", and "game_ui.py" to control the snake.

8. "Food" class: This class will be defined in "game_objects.py" and used in "snake_game.py", "game_logic.py", and "game_ui.py" to control the food.

9. "update_screen" function: This function will be defined in "game_ui.py" and used in "snake_game.py" to update the game interface.

10. "check_collision" function: This function will be defined in "game_logic.py" and used in "snake_game.py" to check for collisions.

11. "move_snake" function: This function will be defined in "game_logic.py" and used in "snake_game.py" to move the snake.

12. "score" variable: This variable will be defined in "game_logic.py" and used in "snake_game.py" and "game_ui.py" to keep track of the score.

13. "game_over" variable: This variable will be defined in "game_logic.py" and used in "snake_game.py" and "game_ui.py" to check if the game is over.
